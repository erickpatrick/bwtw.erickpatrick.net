First of all, thank you for your interest in contacting me. I hope we can talk with each other as soon as possible, and make business together. You can use the following form to contact me:

<Form website="erickpatrick.net" action="/api/contact/create" />

You can also contact me via [@erickpatrick (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/erickpatrick) or via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erickpatrick). I'm everyday on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/erickpatrick) and it's quite quick to get an answer from me in there.

However, if you're really looking for a professional contact, you can preferably contact me through the form above or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erickpatrick). If you do so, the answer may take a little longer (but no longer than a day) and I'll know for sure it's a business related contact.
