Right now, you can contact me via [@erickpatrick (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/erickpatrick). I know it's not much and you may not even have a Twitter account, but I won't make the same mistake of adding my email here again =P

However, soonish, I'll add the a form where you can contact me directly through this page, which will make things much, much easier =)
