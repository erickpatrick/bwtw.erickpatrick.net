First of all, thank you for your interest in contacting me. I hope we can talk with each other as soon as possible, and make business together. For the time being, you can contact me via [@erickpatrick (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/erickpatrick) or via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erickpatrick). Preferably, contact me via LinkedIn as in there I'll know it will be business related.

I'm everyday on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/erickpatrick) and it's quite quick to get an answer from me in there. However, if you're really looking for a professional contact, you can preferably contact me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erickpatrick). If you do so, the answer may take a little longer (but no longer than a day) and I'll know for sure it's a business related contact.

> **Note**: I'm building up a proper contact form which I'll put it only soon. Please, be patient until it's released or contact me via the above mentioned methods. Thank you.
