If you follow me on Twitter, you know that I update the layout and tech stack of this blog quite often. The latest update was about 2 months ago when I switched from a PHP static site generator (Jigsaw) to a JavaScript solution, using Next.js.

Since the beginning, I've managed to migrate and keep basically the same performance and quality scores (i.e., Google Page Speed Insights) as its previous version. But I wanted more.

I knew that React and Preact, most of the times, can be used intechangeably and started looking for a way to use Preact within Next.js instead of React. To my surprise, I've found this [blog post] from Darren White, explaining how he did it. He credits to yet another person, [Lee Robinson] for the solution, so here are his credits as well.

## Performance gains

Before, the initial JavaScript load for this own website was 70kb for the page itself + 30kb shared across all pages, nothing too different from a default Next.js page is. With the use of Preact, it went down to 44KB for the page itself + 30kb shared across all pages. 

Almost 30% reduction by only shifting from React to Preact and, in my case, no changes to what I've coded apart from installing Preact itself and adjusting the `next.config.js` file to use Preact for productions builds only.

```js
// <path-to-nextjs-project-folder>/next.config.js

module.exports = {
  webpack: (config, { dev, isServer }) => {
    // Replace React with Preact only in client production build
    if (!dev && !isServer) {
      Object.assign(config.resolve.alias, {
        react: 'preact/compat',
        'react-dom/test-utils': 'preact/test-utils',
        'react-dom': 'preact/compat',
      });
    }

    return config;
  },

  // [...more configuration here if necessary ...]
};
```

Am I happy with it? Of course! But I'm still gonna look for more performance gains on this little project.

See you in the next article!
