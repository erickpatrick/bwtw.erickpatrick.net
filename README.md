# Black & White TailwindCSS components

## Background
I love the black and white (b&w) color pallete and I love the TailwindCSs framework. The combination of those two is so great I decided to build a personal *Black & White TailwindCSs components* portfolio.

## The components
The components itself are nothing too fancy that would require JavaScript. I have created buttons, forms, content displays, headers and all sort of things, always in b&w.

I've been trying to follow design trends (not only web and mobile but design in general) and also trying create interesting components so others can reuse to create current looking websites.

> **Note**: For the time being there's no proper categorization but I'm planning on adding whenever I see fit.
